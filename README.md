# GUIGradeCalculator
  The goal of this project is to calculate the grade of the student
  for a class.
  
  The Graphic User Interface program takes the whole grade of a student
  in the format 'grade/possible grade, etc...'as one string. When the
  user clicks the button 'Calculate Overall Grade', that string is
  transferred to the 'Grade.java' class which calculates the overall
  grade and returns the result in the box below the menu in the GUI program. 
  
  I used java JFrame class to create a vibrant grade calculator. There are
  three buttons at the left side of the GUI which displays the state of the
  student letter grades depending on what grades were initially entered.
